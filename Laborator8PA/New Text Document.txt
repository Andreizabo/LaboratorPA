# Compulsory  
  
You can add new movies or genres to the database or get existing ones using methods from the two DAO classes, "Movies" and "Genres".  
You can add a genre to a movie using the methods from the "MovieGenre" class, or get the movies of a certain genre/the genres of a certain movies.  
  
# Optional  
  
Actors and directors have been implemented as well as the auxiliary tables for their interations with the rest of the database.  
The database can be populated from a .csv file with any size (it is kind of slow though).  
The database can be exported as html (using freemarker).
