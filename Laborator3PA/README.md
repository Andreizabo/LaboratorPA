# Compulsory  
  
For Compulsory all the relevant information is written in the comments in the java files.

# Optional

The main task, calculating the shortest path between two locations, has been solved
using Dijkstra's Algorithm. A fitting data structure was used to store the path to each
location, until we got to finish, as to not need to recreate the path after finding the 
shortest one.

# Bonus

For the bonus, two implementations were made. First one tries to visit the most preferred
locations first, not prioritizing the overall number of locations visited, whilst the second
implementation only prioritizes how many unvisited locations the tourist can visit in one day.
