# Compulsory  
  
For Compulsory I created methods to save/load a catalog as/from an external file as a text.  
Images, movies, books and other files are stored in their corresponding folder.  
  
The code is [here](https://github.com/Andreizabo/LaboratorPA/tree/main/Laborator5PA/Compulsory/src/main/java).  
  
Note: The program waits for user input for each file to play. You need to enter a character in the console and press enter to play the next file.  
  
# Optional  
  
To run the program, use [run.bat](https://github.com/Andreizabo/LaboratorPA/tree/main/Laborator5PA/Optional/run.bat).  
These are the possible commands:  
* new "[catalog name]" "[save path]"  
* add "[catalog]" "[Item Type] '[item arg 1]' '[item arg 2]' '[item arg n]'"  
* list "[catalog]"  
* load "[catalog in which to load]" "[path to catalog to load]"  
* save "[catalog to save]" "[path]"  
* play "[catalog]" "[item index]"
