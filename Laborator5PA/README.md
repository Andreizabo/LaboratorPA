# Compulsory  
  
For Compulsory I created methods to save/load a catalog as/from an external file as a text.
Images, movies, books and other files are stored in their corresponding folder.
  
The code is [here](https://github.com/Andreizabo/LaboratorPA/tree/main/Laborator5PA/Compulsory/src/main/java)
