# Compulsory  
  
For Compulsory I created methods to save/load a catalog as/from an external file as a text.  
Images, movies, books and other files are stored in their corresponding folder.  
  
The code is [here](https://github.com/Andreizabo/LaboratorPA/tree/main/Laborator5PA/Compulsory/src/main/java).  
  
Note: The program waits for user input for each file to play. You need to enter a character in the console and press enter to play the next file.
