# Compulsory  
  
Each player will draw a token once every one second, if there is one available. The function to draw tokens is synchronized, so no more than one player can draw one particular token at one time.  
The game ends when there are no more tokens available.  
  
# Optional  
  
The following additions/modifications were made:
