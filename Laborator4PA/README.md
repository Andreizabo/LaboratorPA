# Compulsory  
  
For Compulsory I used a LinkedList to store the students and a TreeSet to store the schools.
I also created two maps, a LinkedListMap and a TreeMap to store the preferences of each student/school  
  
# Optional  
  
For Optional I implemented a greedy algorithm to solve the problem. It will sort the students
based on their grade (if the grade is equal, based on name) and then assign each one to their
most preferred school that isn't already full.  
I used [java-faker](https://github.com/DiUS/java-faker) for the random names.
