# Compulsory  
  
For Compulsory I created a shape drawer. It can draw the following shapes:  
* Circles (You can specify the colour and the radius)  
* Regular Polygons (You can specify the colour, the size, the number of edges and the rotation)  
  
I used JavaFX for the GUI.  
  
# Optional  
  
For Optional I extended the program implemented for Compulsory:  
* You can add outline to any shape, with custom colour and width  
* You can erase shapes, using the Eraser tool  
* You can Free Draw. The program will try to match what you've drawn with a pre-defined shape. It can identify lines, circles and triangles so far.  
  
Other changes:  
* Changed some names
